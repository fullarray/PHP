# PHP Programs, Algorithms, Applications, Patterns.

This is my Git repository for projects based solely on PHP, used as either local client or server-side scripting.

## Getting Started

I created this repo in order to organize my public PHP work. This repo, therefore, serves a dual purpose as it helps me keep control of what I worked on while providing potential employers a sneak-peek of what've been up to for the last several years. 

### Prerequisites

You may need PHP and a web server to run any of the code that's here within.

You can check your PHP's version by running the following command on any platform:
```
PHP --version
```

### Installing

If you don't have PHP, you can download it from the official PHP site at:

```
http://www.php.org
```
